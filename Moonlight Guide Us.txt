Moonlight Guide Us <Darren Korb:w Darren Korb:p>
 - from Hades II


[Verse 1: Ashley Barrett, Ashley Barrett & Judy Alice Lee]
Unseen
Hidden in the wild wood
Sheltered by the dark
The Silver Sisters wait
The Moon marks her passage silently
Watching with the Eye
Of Night above us all, hiding in plain sight
Keeper of the night

[Chorus: Ashley Barrett & Judy Alice Lee]
Moonlight, guide us home tonight
In shadow, all are one
Take shelter from the world above
In safety and in solitude, the Sisters wait

[Verse 2: Ashley Barrett, Ashley Barrett & Judy Alice Lee]
Shades
Lost and ever-wandering
Stranded after life
A crossroad in the gloom
The Moon lights your way through the wild woods
Twisting through the dark
To find your refuge here, be welcome here and safe
The Silver Sisters wait
See pop shows near Nashville

[Chorus: Ashley Barrett & Judy Alice Lee]
Moonlight, guide you home tonight
In shadow, all are one
Take shelter from the world above
In safety and in solitude, the Sisters wait

Moonlight Guide Us is a song from Hades II, occasionally sung by Artemis, the goddess of the hunt- voiced by Ashley Barrett- whenever she’s in the hub area of the game, The Crossroads. The player character, Melinoë- voiced by Judy Alice Lee- can choose to join in if the player wishes.

An instrumental version can be bought from the Music Maker for 500 Kudos and 1 Ambrosia Bottle and played in-game when Artemis is not in the hub-area.
